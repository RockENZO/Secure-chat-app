Possible Vulnerabilities:
In the file transfer system, when a file is sent, the recipient is automatically prompted to download the
file. While the user needs to manually accept the file, this could still open a potential attack vector if a
malicious payload is set to run immediately after downloading.

Another possible vulnerability with the file server is that files are permanently stored in the “uploads”
folder on the server once they are sent to a user. A carefully crafted malicious file can be planted on
the server to gain access to data, such as private and public keys, which are created and stored in the
root directory of the server. The server’s source code can also potentially be modified using this
method to implement additional backdoors.

It is also possible to have two separate users with the same username, but with a unique client ID,
although they cannot send messages to each other. However, as the client does not show each user’s
user ID, it is impossible to verify which user sent the message.
